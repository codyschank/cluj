Now using the ESPN API, which is completely undocumented, but perhaps a better way to pull than data than web scraping. 

- Schedule boxscore scraper to run every day in the morning
- Schedule matchup data to run every day in the morning
- Create a "dashboard" using Rshiny

- How to account for situations where more players have games than you can start on a given day 
- How to weight sampling towards more recent games
- Actually create a model to predict scoring based on opponent, teammates injured (at same position)

- What players have more/fewer matchups during the playoffs? Round 1 3/16 - 3/22, Round 2 3/23-3/29, Round 3 3/30 - 4/5

- Giannis Round 1: 3, Round 2: 4, Round 3: 3
- Jokic Round 1: 3, Round 2: 3, Round 3: 4
- Buddy Round 1: 4, Round 2: 3, Round 3: 4
