The notebook 'scrape_testing' uses selenium to log in to espn and scrape data from my fantasy basketball league. 

**Selenium installation instructions:**
1. Download chromedriver here: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started
2. Put the chromedriver in your /usr/local/bin folder (mac) or c:/windows folder (windows). TODO: look into using homebrew to install chromedriver on a mac

**Next steps:**
1. Do matchup comparison based on cumulative stats expected across number of games for each player during that matchup.
